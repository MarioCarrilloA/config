The expected layout for this subdirectory is as follows:

kubernetes
|-- applications
|   `-- stx-openstack
|       `-- manifest.yaml
|-- helm-charts
|   `-- placeholder
|       `-- placeholder.txt
`-- README

The idea is that all our custom helm charts would go under "helm-charts".  Each
chart would get a subdirectory.

Custom applications would generally consist of an armada manifest referencing
multiple helm charts (both ours and upstream ones).  These applications would
each get their own subdirectory under "applications".
